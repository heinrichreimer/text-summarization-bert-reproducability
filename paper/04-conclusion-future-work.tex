\section{Conclusion and Future Work} % 30/300 points, 10%

Is the chosen approach good enough to consider the problem solved?
Which difficulties in the original approach did arise during reproducing the experiments?

\subsection{Future Work}

Which fields do we consider relevant/important for future research?

Use smaller \Bert model, e.g. \BertTiny. Can that be trained with less resources? Does it generate good summaries?

Tune hyperparameters for the transformer decoder, an evaluation that is missing from the replicated paper.

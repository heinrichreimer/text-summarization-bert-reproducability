yanukovych seems to keep getting dimmer . a news conference friday from his new quarters in southeastern russia underscored just how dim his prospects appear to be , as the ousted ukrainian president complained that his host -- and potential benefactor -- was not around and had done little to make his stay more comfortable . \" i consider that russia must and has to act , \" yanukovych told a phalanx of reporters who had assembled in the city of rostov-on-don , near the southwestern border with ukraine and about 700 miles south of moscow . he did not specify what actions he was hoping for but made clear whom he was looking to . \" knowing the character of mr. vladimir putin , i am surprised why , up 'til now , he has remained restrained , silent . that is the question . \" though he and the russian president had talked over the phone , they had not met , said yanukovych , who appeared to concede that he did not know where putin stands on his ouster and was hoping for clarity -- whenever the two men get together . \" as soon as this meeting takes place , i will understand his attitude . ... it would not be correct now for me to speak about what russia should do now . ... russia must use all its possibilities in order to overcome this chaos , this terror which today is taking place in ukraine . it is difficult for me to say what can come about , but i would like to say again that i am categorically against any interference with the sovereign integrity of ukraine as a state . \" the location of the news conference itself underscored his isolation . \" i 'm struck by the fact that he 's in rostov-on-don and not in moscow and that he has had a phone call with president putin and not met , \" former u.s. ambassador to russia michael mcfaul told cnn . \" i thought he expressed dismay that president putin has not been more decisive to defend him . \" he cited yanukovych 's comments as \" signs that he is not in good standing with his current host . \" for his part , putin discussed developments in ukraine in a telephone call with european leaders , stressing the importance of avoiding an escalation of violence , according to a statement from the kremlin , which did not cite yanukovych . in a rambling news conference that lasted for more than an hour , the ousted leader spoke in russian instead of the ukrainian that he has used at official functions . though he insisted that he 's still the boss and wants nothing more than to lead his country to peace , harmony and prosperity , he offered little evidence that he was in a position to do much about it . he pleaded for forgiveness \" from all who have suffered \" in the chaos and violence that have roiled the country in recent weeks . he said he would \" bow down to all of them , no matter which side of the barricades they were on , \" but then unleashed a volley of epithets targeting those who were on the side of the barricades that opposed him , referring to them as \" bandits \" and \" fascists . \" wearing a dark business suit and tie , he cut a lonely figure as he held forth from a table , behind which stood four blue-and-yellow ukrainian flags . during the news conference , he appeared contained as he fiddled with his pen . but he betrayed the pressure , staring down at his hands , which were on the table , bending a pen . when it snapped , he grimaced , then looked up and continued speaking . \" everything that i can do , i will do to the end of my life to be with the people of ukraine -- not with those nationalists , not with those bandits , but the people of ukraine , \" he said , adding that western countries , including the united states , bore some of the blame for the unrest . he said that he had left his country only after his life and the lives of his family were threatened and that he planned to return when it is safe to do so . \" a normal way of life must be assured to the citizens of ukraine , both in kiev and in all regions of ukraine , \" he said , and he called for a national referendum \" as soon as possible . \" elections planned for may 25 in ukraine would be illegal , he said , adding that he would not participate in them if they are held . \" i consider that all the elections must take place in accordance with the law and constitution of ukraine , \" he said . yanukovych said he was \" ashamed \" that he had not been able to maintain stability in his country . \" i want to apologize in front of everybody -- to the veterans , to the ukrainian people -- that i did not have the strength to stop what is now taking place in the country from taking place , \" he said . but he said that \" any military action \" would be unacceptable . \" ukraine must remain united and undivided , \" he said , adding that the russian-majority crimean region must remain part of the state but given \" broad autonomy . \" yanukovych , who is wanted in ukraine on charges related to the killings of demonstrators last week in kiev , denied having ordered police to fire on them , killing scores . \" no government can succeed with bloodshed , and everything that has taken place is the responsibility of those who did it , \" he said . \" i never gave any order for the police to shoot , \" he said , asserting that they fired in self-defense in the face of \" an attack of a mass character . \""</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"ex-envoy

' mdsec 's total setup cost around # 200 ( \$ 297 ) , and the researchers explained that because each pin entry takes approximately 40 seconds - including the phone shutting down - it can take more than four days to bruteforce a four-digit code . the hack also only works if a criminal has stolen or found the phone , and it only applies to phones running ios 8.1 or older . apple has reportedly fixed the bug in 8.1.1 and people running older versions of the software are advised to update to the latest version . by connecting directly to the phone 's power source it can override the ` erase

famous exports , the beatles . but liverpool 's footballers wo n't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at swansea to set up a pivotal clash with manchester united at the weekend . one of english soccer 's biggest rivalries is renewed on sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season 's european champions league . jordan henderson knew little about his winner in wales , the ball flying in after jordi amat 's clearance struck him , but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the reds . a sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of manchester united in fourth , with just four points separating liverpool from manchester city in second . \" it 's a great result , \" henderson told sky sports . \" the first half was disappointing but i felt as though we did better in second half , passed the ball and created a few chances . \" it was a great pass by daniel , i got a little fortunate with the finish but you 've got to be in the right position to score . \" overall we 're delighted with three points and we now look forward to sunday . we ca n't wait for it , we are high on confidence and have great momentum but united played well the other day . \" it 'll be a tough one but at anfield we go in confident and hopefully we 'll get the result we need . \" in a lackluster start , daniel sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for liverpool before england international adam lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at swansea goalkeeper lukasz fabianski . from then on swansea asserted control . martin skrtel had to be alert to clear as swansea 's french striker bafetimbi gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal . gomis then played a neat one-two with wayne routledge before forcing liverpool goalkeeper simon mignolet into a fine low save . next to threaten liverpool 's net was iceland international gylfi sigurdsson , whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before mignolet intervened . just before halftime jonjo shelvey , a former liverpool player , went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by alberto moreno . but having had a chance to regroup , liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot . first fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out philippe coutinho 's near post effort before the pole was then in action again to deny joe allen . though liverpool were in the ascendency , its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck . as henderson galloped onto a through ball swansea 's spanish defender amat got there first , but his clearance ricocheted off the liverpool player and into the net past fabianski . from then on liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter , striker daniel sturridge hitting the post late on as swansea left gaps at the back . in the fa cup -- england 's premier cup competition -- second tier reading sealed a trip to wembley to face arsenal in the final four after beating bradford 3-0 . goals from hal robson-kanu and garath mccleary inside nine minutes punished third tier bradford , before jamie mackie added a third in the closing stages . reading will face arsenal in april while the other semifinal sees aston villa play either

' when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery . if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces . from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force . called ` dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe . the galaxy , named reticulum 2 , was discovered within the past few weeks in the data of the dark energy survey . at 98,000 light-years from earth , reticulum 2 is one of the nearest dwarf galaxies yet detected according to physicists at carnegie mellon , brown and cambridge universities , gamma rays coming from the direction of the galaxy are in excess of what would be expected from normal background . ` something in the direction of this dwarf galaxy is emitting gamma rays , ' said alex geringer-sameth , a postdoctoral research associate at carnegie mellon university . ` there 's no conventional reason this galaxy should be giving off gamma rays , so it 's potentially a signal for dark matter , ' said alex geringer-sameth , a postdoctoral research associate in cmu 's department of physics and the paper 's lead author . ` in the search for dark matter , gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature , ' added brown university 's savvas koushiappas koushiappas , an assistant professor of physics . ` it seems like we may now be detecting such a thing for the first time . ' the researchers caution that while these preliminary results are exciting , there 's more work to be done to confirm a dark matter origin . scientists know that dark matter exists because it exerts gravitational effects on visible matter , which explains the observed rotation of galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background . dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle . they are thought to lack other gamma-ray-producing sources , so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter . pictured is an artist 's impression of the jet from a gamma-ray burst emerging at nearly light speed ` the gravitational detection of dark matter tells you very little about the particle behaviour of the dark matter , ' said matthew walker , assistant professor of physics and a member of cmu 's mcwilliams center for cosmology . gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature of dark matter . a leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are wimps , or weakly interacting massive particles . when pairs of wimps meet , they annihilate one another , giving off high-energy gamma rays . if that 's true , then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where wimps are thought to be plentiful , like the dense centres of galaxies . ` but now we may have a non-gravitational detection that shows dark matter behaving like a particle , which is a holy grail of sorts . ' a leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are wimps , or weakly interacting massive particles . when pairs of wimps meet , they annihilate one another , giving off high-energy gamma rays . if that 's true , then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where wimps are thought to be plentiful , like the dense centres of galaxies . the trouble is , the high-energy rays also originate from many other sources , including black holes and pulsars , which makes it difficult to untangle a dark matter signal from the background noise . that 's why dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle . they are thought to lack other gamma-ray-producing sources , so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter . ` they 're basically very clean and quiet systems , ' professor koushiappas said . scientists have been looking at them for signs of gamma rays for the last several years using nasa 's fermi gamma-ray space telescope . there 's never been a convincing signal , until now . further study of this dwarf galaxy 's attributes could reveal hidden sources that may be emitting gamma rays , but the

team of international researchers is hoping after finding a genetic marker linked to ptsd in the blood samples of marines stationed in conflict zones . \" we 'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for ptsd , \" says principal investigator dr. dewleen baker of the university of california-san diego . \" it 's exciting . \" ptsd can occur after many types of trauma : rape , torture , child abuse , natural disasters and car , plane , and train wrecks , to name a few . according to the ptsd alliance , more than 13 million americans have ptsd and the societal cost is in the billions . women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder . symptoms tend to cluster into three areas : • reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images , along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking , chills or heart palpitations . • avoiding reminders of the event , including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends , family and everyday activities . • being hyperaroused , easily startled , irritable , angry , or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating . as one might expect , service members are hardest hit . the department of veterans affairs estimates 30 % of all vietnam vets have experienced ptsd . among troops recently deployed to iraq and afghanistan , ptsd can run as high as 20 % in any given year . but why does severe emotional trauma trigger ptsd in some people and not others ? the idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop ptsd is a popular focus of recent research . scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice . the lack of a fear-regulating brain chemical called gastrin-releasing peptide led to greater fear response among the rodents . in another study , mice without a protein necessary to form \" fear memories \" were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces . studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30 % of the differences in response to trauma , with identical twins much more likely to both develop ptsd than fraternal twins . other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences , mental disorders , or addictive tendencies . an unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of ptsd symptoms . prior studies of people diagnosed with ptsd compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role . \" the body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system , \" says baker , discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals . \" the systems all talk to each other . \" the recent study , published in the journal molecular psychiatry , is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 marines taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones . another group of 96 marines was also studied to verify the results . \" under this experimental design , not only can we identify differences between u.s. marines with ptsd and without , but we can go back in time , so to speak , to see if any of the marines who eventually developed ptsd \" showed evidence that it would emerge , says the study 's co-senior author , christopher woelk . \" in this vein , we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively ` causal ' in nature . \" in the blood of marines ultimately diagnosed with ptsd , the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body 's first line of defense -- and interferon , a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action . in addition , this hypervigilant immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma . \" why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less ? is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen ? \" instead of pathogens , another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war . \" you could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of ptsd , \" says baker . baker stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded . \" we 're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience , and with more research we 'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments , \" says baker ."</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"more than 13 million americans have ptsd . genes account for about 30 % of risk . immune system plays a role in risk

that 's easier said than done . anyone who has tried cutting down on sugar knows to avoid cookies , sodas and candy . but sugar can be hidden in lots of other common packaged foods . the world health organization finalized guidelines wednesday saying people should keep intake of added sugars to just five to ten per cent of overall calories , which translates to about 25 to 50 grams of sugar a day for most people . be warned : according to experts , many supermarket soup varieties can contain up to two teaspoons of sugar in just one can the guidelines do n't apply to naturally occurring sugars in fruits , vegetables and milk , since they come with essential nutrients . in the u.s. , adults get about 11 to 15 per cent of their calories from sugar ; the figure for children tops that at about 16 per cent . by comparison , sugar intakes ranges in europe from about seven per cent in hungary to nearly 25 percent in portugal . but research indicates that many people are n't aware of how much sugar they 're eating every day . in fact , that 's one reason the u.s. food and drug administration is proposing the first overhaul of nutrition labels in two decades . in addition to highlighting the number of calories per serving in a bigger , bolder font , the new proposed labels would also for the first time list sugars that are added by manufacturers . while salad might seem like the healthy option , the dressings used to add flavor to them are often loaded with sugars in the meantime , though , companies do n't currently disclose how much of the sugar listed in the nutrition panels of their products are from added sugars rather than naturally occurring ones . according to health experts , many everyday food products , which some might perceive to be completely healthy , are actually loaded with hidden sugars . salad dressings , soups , yogurts and cereals have all been named as some of the worst offenders when it comes to sugar content ; the popular deluxe french salad dressing from wish-bone , for example , has four grams of sugar per serving - meaning it has around one teaspoon of sugar for every two tablespoons of dressing . similarly , progresso 's rich and hearty beef pot roast contains four grams of sugar per serving which means there are approximately two teaspoons of sugar in every can . ` in reality , we find ( these sugars ) in the majority of products , ' francesco branca , who heads the world health oganization 's department of nutrition for health and development , said . salad dressing : picking a salad over a ham sandwich seems like a virtuous choice . but the amount of sugar it comes with can vary depending on the dressing you put on top of it . wish-bone 's deluxe french salad dressing , for instance , lists four grams ( about one teaspoon ) of sugar per serving ( two tablespoons ) . soup : a cup of soup of soup is comforting thought , but even savory varieties can have sugar . a can of progresso 's rich and hearty beef pot roast has four grams ( about one teaspoon ) of sugar per serving , with a can containing two servings . yogurt : another seemingly healthful choice that can come with lots of sugar . some of the sugar is naturally occurring from the dairy , but companies add sweeteners too . a container of chobani 's 0 % fat greek yogurt in black cherry flavor lists 17 grams ( about four teaspoons ) of sugar . bread : that toast you 're about to smother with jam might 've already been a little sweetened . a store brand of enriched white bread at the convenience store chain duane reade listed two grams ( about half a teaspoon ) of sugar for per serving ( two slices ) . peanut butter : it depends on the variety you pick , but peanut butter can come with added sugar too . skippy 's super chunk variety lists seven grams ( almost two teaspoons ) of sugar per serving ( two tablespoons ) . cereal : most people know that cereal has sugar , especially the varieties for kids . in some cases , you might be surprised that there is n't much difference between options . special k with red berries , for instance , has nine grams ( more than two teaspoons ) per serving ( one cup ) , while frosted flakes has ten grams ( more than two teaspoons ) of sugar per serving ( 3/4 cup ) . frozen meals : in case it was n't clear by now , just because it 's not dessert does n't mean it does n't have added sugar . california kitchen 's bbq chicken microwavable pizza has seven grams ( almost two teaspoons ) of sugar in a single-serving pie ."</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"the world health organization is

highest court friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of american amanda knox , according to judge gennaro marasca . the high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of knox and her italian ex-boyfriend , or send the case back for another appeal , or potentially on to a different section of the court . knox , a 27-year-old seattle native , and raffaele sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of knox 's british roommate , meredith kercher . knox and kercher lived together in italy at the time of kercher 's death . sollecito and knox were acquitted in 2011 on appeal , and then knox returned to the united states . however , italy 's supreme court overturned the acquittals in 2013 , and they were convicted last year after a retrial . if a new trial is ordered , knox and sollecito will buy a little time before a final decision is reached . but if the court upholds the conviction , the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to knox next is uncertain . conventional wisdom dictates that knox will eventually face an extradition hearing or reach a deal with the italian justice ministry to serve her 28-year sentence , but that could take years . the statute of limitations is double the sentence , meaning the italians have 57 years to bring her back to the country . knox , however , would benefit from the united states ' extradition treaty with italy -- under which the united states will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the u.s. constitution 's protection against double jeopardy . sollecito , on the other hand , still lives in italy , and has a lot more to lose than knox does , at least in the short term . he would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25-year sentence . all of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail . sollecito earlier said he would be in court on wednesday to face the judge . \" i 've been living this for eight years , \" he told the italian crime tv program \" quarto grado . \" not appearing in court would be like hiding in the corner during a tsunami -- it will take you away anyway . \" rudy guede , from the ivory coast , was convicted separately in a fast-track trial and is midway through a 16-year sentence for kercher 's murder . his case was confirmed by italy 's high court in 2010 . many commentators in the u.s. have reasoned that italy may not ask the united states for knox 's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations . but there could be a greater rift if it appears that knox gets away with murder and her italian ex-boyfriend pays for the crime . if sollecito is languishing in prison and knox is sipping frappuccino in a seattle starbucks , italians will not be pleased , says alessandro capponi , an italian journalist for corriere della sera who has been covering the case since kercher was killed in 2007 . \" it will be seen as an injustice , \" capponi told cnn . \" you may not see people out on the streets , but if you ask 10 people what they think , those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the italian and the african are in prison . the italians will say that the american gets away with murder and it wo n't be the first time . \" this is not the first time italy and the united states have butted heads on matters involving american suspects accused of crimes in italy . in 1998 , an american marine aircraft sliced through a ski lift cable in the dolomites , sending 20 people plummeting to their death . even after admitting to destroying the videotape of the deadly flight , only two of the four marines were charged and convicted . only one served jail time -- just over four months of a six-month sentence . in 2012 , italy 's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 americans ( 22 cia agents and an air force pilot ) for the kidnapping of egyptian cleric abu omar , a suspeced terrorist , from a street in milan . they were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison , but italy has not yet asked for extradition . \" our relationship with the united states is full of these diplomatic tensions , \" said capponi . \" this will just be added to the list . \" knox 's case has been divisive from the start , and her supporters have come down hard on the italian judicial system . sollecito has never had the luxury of that attitude , knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not , so vocally criticizing it would n't be in his best interest . in fact , he has long suffered the impact of knox 's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized italy from the other side of the atlantic . by almost any italian precedent , sollecito should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because knox was deemed a flight risk , she had to stay in jail . because sollecito was her co-defendant , he did too , even though he had no ties to anyone abroad . \" knox could still beat the system , but sollecito 's game is up if the convictions are upheld , \" nicola canestrini , an italian extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems , told cnn . \" he has no wiggle room and it could be that he serves the time for both of them , which will likely cause deep resentment here in italy . \" perhaps a little too late , sollecito 's defense team has been slowly inching away from knox , especially since the latest conviction . last summer , he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court , in which his lawyer giulia bongiorno pointed out \" certain anomalies \" in knox 's testimony that have nothing to do with sollecito . \" we ask that the court to not extend the anomalies of amanda 's testimony to raffaele , \" bongiorno said at the time . whether that is enough to get the high court to give sollecito another , independent chance is yet to be seen . \" i am not a crazy person . i am not a criminal . i am innocent , \" sollecito told reporters last summer at the press conference . \" but my name is raffaele sollecito , not amanda marie knox . \" now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference . cnn 's hada messia contributed to this report ."</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"italy 's

' of course , as a goalkeeper , bell can afford to be more sanguine than outfield players . all things being equal , he should still be playing at a high level for another decade or so . that , however , does not mean he is n't impatient for success . some former rangers players , including barry ferguson , the 2003 treble-winning captain , have claimed that another season in the championship may prove beneficial for the ibrox club while the first-team squad is dismantled and rebuilt from scratch . lee wallace 's scotland career is effectively over bell does n't see it that way and he wants last sunday 's unexpected victory over play-off rivals hibs to be the starting point on the road to rangers returning to the top flight this year . ` i can only speak for myself , and i want to be playing in the top league , ' he said . ` you 've got to be ambitious as a player and i want to play at the highest level i can with rangers . ` i 'm desperate to be back in the top league and i 'm sure everyone else associated with the club is as well . we know it 's going to be hard but there 's still a great chance we can do it . ` we need to be playing well going into the play-offs so it really starts from now . we have to take some good form into them . we have nine games left in the league and we have to show we can do it on the pitch . ' new owner dave king would also appreciate promotion being achieved sooner rather than later . with shareholder mile ashley seemingly having a stranglehold on the bulk of the profits arising from the club 's retail operation , the financially-challenged club need a fresh injection of cash . in the last few days the three bears consortium of douglas park , george letham and george taylor have donated # 1.5 million in order to pay this month 's wages but season-ticket renewal money in may , ideally at increased premiership rates , is likely to be vital . bell was speaking yesterday to publicise a new four-match ticket package for this season 's remaining home games but the improved performance against hibs will have done as much to increase attendances at ibrox for those fixtures . as far as the goalkeeper is concerned , however , there is more to come from stuart mccall 's side between now and the end of may . ` yes , we 've set a high bar but , at the end of the day , we are playing for rangers football club so the bar should be set high , ' he said . ` we can handle that : we should be able to handle the pressure and i 'm sure we will . that performance has been in us all season and it was just a case of trying to bring it out of us . ` i 'm sure we 'll take confidence from it and we 'll work hard on the training pitch to make sure we are ready for games . ' bell credited mccall for the transformation in the atmosphere at ibrox . the former motherwell manager has dispelled the gloom which surrounded the club during the dog days of mccoist and kenny mcdowall . ` i think it 's just down to the enthusiasm the new manager has brought , ' he said . ` he 's brought a spark to training too . bell played for kilmarnock when he won his only scotland cap ` he was always a passionate player himself and he soon lets us know if we are doing things right in training . he 's been great and he 's brought a new lease of life to some players . ` it 's a good start for us but we know there will be tough times ahead so we need to just take each game as it comes and concentrate on getting three points in the next game .

is there a successor in place ? is there anyone who would continue putin 's policies ? if there is a power vacuum , a conceivable scenario given just how thoroughly putin dominates , what would the consequences be ? whatever putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers , visiting with friends , or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead , the internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today 's russian state , who dismantled the country 's once-fledgling democracy , wo n't be around forever . which raises the question , what then ?"</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"frida ghitis : it 's unclear where president vladimir putin is at the moment . ghitis : speculation about his whereabouts went viral as russian officials posted old photos"</pre></v></r></jlstruct></jltree></v></r><r><k>13363</k><v><jltree class="collapsed">SummaryPair<jlstruct><r><k>source</k><v><pre>"the southern california teacher found hanging from her classroom ceiling knew the devastating effects of suicide after her own father took his life four years ago . photography teacher jillian jacobson , 31 , had spoken to students about the death of her father , richard prisbey , 55 , and had even told one class of students a few weeks ago , that if they ever felt down to ask for help . the teacher , who was discovered at el dorado high school in placentia , california on monday by her own students , also taught a week-long unit on depression for freshmen . photography teacher jillian jacobson ( left with a student ) , 31 , had spoken to students about the death of her father , richard prisbey , 55 , and had even told one class of students a few weeks ago , that if they ever felt down to ask for help the southern california teacher found hanging from her classroom ceiling knew the devastating effects of suicide after her own father took his life four years ago ( mrs jacobson pictured left and right ) . mrs jacobson , who was discovered at el dorado high school in placentia , california , by her own students , also taught a week-long unit on depression for freshmen on monday evening , 500 students gathered outside the school 's gate , lighting candles and leaving written tributes ( above ) for their teacher , and the following day , the candles remained at the site with a few still burning she emphasized that suicide was not the answer to anyone 's problems and that it deeply affected many people . mrs jacobson 's father went missing in 2011 after leaving his job and was found dead two days later with a bullet wound to his head in an isolated desert area . his death was ruled as a suicide , according to a coroner 's report . her students said her father 's suicide clearly impacted troubled mrs jacobson , but she kept her composure and did not get emotional when she talked about it with her class . her students said her father 's suicide clearly impacted troubled mrs jacobson , but she kept her composure and did not get emotional when she talked about it with her class ( above student cj holton places her candle during a candlelight vigil for the popular teacher ) mrs jacobson 's father went missing after leaving his job and was found dead in 2011 with a bullet wound to his head in an isolated desert . his death was ruled as a suicide , according to a coroner 's report ( above students light their candles ) her shocking death stood in stark contrast to the teacher students said they knew , and described her as someone cheerful and trusted , who inspired in many a love of photography ( mrs jacobson pictured right ) no one could point to any recent warning signs that she was distressed , though one student noted that she lost a lot of weight . her shocking death stood in stark contrast to the teacher students said they knew , and described her as someone cheerful and trusted , who inspired in many a love of photography . during students ' first-period class on tuesday , a school administrator delivered an announcement on the loudspeaker saying they would all miss mrs jacobson , and that they had to remain united . several students said they were confused and did not know how to process the information , while others have not been able to stop replaying the events in their heads . on monday evening , 500 students gathered outside the school 's gate , lighting candles and leaving written tributes for their teacher , and the following day , the candles remained at the site with a few still burning . alexandra sanchez , 18 , recalled how her classroom went numb when their teacher left the room and returned flustered , telling the class : ` mrs jacobson just hung herself .

' i very much believe that that is the right policy . that we 'll be even more transparent . that to eliminate any questions while we 're in this time , we wo n't take new government funding , but that the work will continue as it is . ' accepting funds from companies tied to foreign governments presents the appearance of a conflict of interest for the clinton foundation , since it 's one avenue through which countries could try to influence hillary and extract sweetheart deals from washington . the foundation is also under fire for handing the internal revenue service incomplete or incorrect accounting of how much money it received from foreign governments . chelsea clinton defended her family philanthropy on thursday in new york , calling it ` among the most transparent of foundations ' reuters reported on thursday that the clinton foundation and its associated charities will re-file at least five annual tax returns to correct the mistakes . the errors involve under-reporting , over-reporting or misclassifying millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments . in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , according to reuters , the clinton foundation reported to the irs that it received zero dollars from foreign and u.s. governments . that number stood out because it reported tens of millions in foreign government contributions pressure : likely republican presidential candidate carly fiorina slammed the clintons for ` making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep ' foreign governments had continued to give tens of millions of dollars toward the foundation 's work on climate change and the foundation listed the donors on its publicly available donor lists , but omitted them in its tax filings . hillary clinton is seeing a flurry of new scrutiny applied to her years as secretary of state now that she has announced a 2016 presidential run . her chief female republican rival , former hewlett-packard ceo carly fiorina , said thursday that alleged links between the clinton foundation , former president bill clinton 's speaking fees and mrs. clinton 's leadership at state are disturbing . ` it 's the clinton way : raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep , ' fiorina said in a statement . ` now they 're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as secretary of state . ' the russian uranium story is one piece of a larger puzzle . when rosatom purchased 51 per cent of uranium one , which controls a reported one-fifth of the uranium made in the us , the reported \$ 610 million sale needed to be approved by a committee of government agencies , including the state department . committee on foreign investment in the united states approved the majority ownership deal in 2010 . jose fernandez , a former assistant secretary of state , was the principal state department representative on the committee , and said that clinton did not intervene with his work . no one ` has ever produced a shred of evidence supporting the theory that hillary clinton ever took action as secretary of state to support the interests of donors to the clinton foundation , ' according to foundation spokesman brian fallon . the clinton foundation has become lucrative for one of america 's most powerful political families , with bill clinton receiving \$ 26 million in speaking fees from donors to the charity . above , clinton speaks in january approval of uranium one 's sale helped russian state nuclear agency rosatom gain control of uranium assets in the us and kazakhstan ( pictured ) he said that is was ` utterly baseless ' to say that clinton helped push the deal through while her foundation received a windfall in donations . when clinton joined the obama administration as secretary of state , she signed an agreement saying that the clinton foundation would not receive money from foreign governments and disclose all donors . however , the donations from uranium one 's telfer reveal that it was still accepting undisclosed donations from private individuals whose businesses and interests aligned with governments such as russia or businesses . sixty companies that lobbied the state department when hillary clinton was secretary donated \$ 26 million to the foundation , at the time run by her husband , according to the wall street journal . the clinton foundation only reported that telfer gave it \$ 250,000 , though tax records reviewed by the new york times show that telfer 's fernwood foundation gave \$ 1 million in 2009 , \$ 250,000 in 2010 , \$ 600,000 in 2011 and \$ 500,000 in 2012 . telfer said that his donations were to support his friend frank giustra , who has deep ties to the clintons and once benefited from bill 's presence on a business trip to kazakhstan . up to \$ 5.6 million may have come from other individuals associated with uranium one . the revelations about possible connections between the clinton foundation and hillary 's work in the state department come as more information has been gathered about how the charity lined the pockets of one of america 's most powerful political families . bill clinton has made a total of \$ 26 million in speakers fees from donors to the clinton foundation , according to a report in the washington post . the former president has received more than \$ 100 million in speaking fees since leaving office , though how much of that was from organizations that also donated to his foundation has not previously been known . some of the biggest donors to the foundation are financial institutions goldman sachs , barclays capital , deutsche bank and citigroup , which personally paid bill clinton \$ 3 million in speaking fees . then-senator hillary clinton listens to a briefing from the committee on foreign investment in the united states , the organization where she would later help approve russia 's purchase of us uranium assets bill clinton 's trip to kazakhstan and its president nursultan nazarbayev ( pictured ) helped paved the way for a major foundation donor frank giustra to start a booming uranium business there canadian businessman frank giustra ( right ) got a sweetheart uranium mining deal from nazarbayev in 2008 with clinton 's help , a year after launching a ` sustainable development initiative ' with the clinton foundation ; giustra pledged \$ 100 million and half his earnings from mining to the foundation his june 2010 speech to leading russian officials at an event for renaissance capital netted him \$ 500,000 . clinton met with vladimir putin , at the time russia 's prime minister , during his visit . all of the business dealings linked to the clinton foundation took place during the obama administration 's ` reset ' in us relations with russia . bill clinton also engaged in activities in the post-soviet world not directly tied to his foundation . in 2005 he flew to kazakhstan with a canadian uranium mining financier frank giustra and met the country 's despotic president nursultan nazarbayev . clinton 's appearance is seen as helping giustra secure a deal to start his urasia uranium company in kazakhstan , which would later merge with uranium one . giustra would donate \$ 31.3 million to the clinton foundation in 2006 and helped start the clinton giustra sustainable growth initiative . russia would ultimately benefit from the deal and clinton 's involvement , and was able to secure more uranium production in its own backyard when took majority control of uranium one in 2010 and 100 per cent control in 2013 . rosatom said that it would not export any of the uranium out of the united states , though a rancher at the nuclear material facility in wyoming said that the uranium is often taken for processing in canada . news of the clinton foundation 's ties to uranium executives comes after criticism of the clinton 's ties to additional eastern european money , from the ukrainian oligarch that became one of their foundation 's biggest donors . victor pinchuk , the fourth richest man in ukraine , was found to have done business with iranian government despite us sanctions against the middle eastern country when he sold their oil and gas pipes in 2011 and 2012 , according to newsweek . many of the recent revelations have come from a book called ` clinton cash ' , written by investigative journalist peter schweizer . supporters of hillary clinton 's fledgling presidential campaign say that the book is a partisan conservative attack . a spokesman for the campaign said that the uranium one deal went through the normal approval process and that schweizer 's book is ` twisting previously known facts into absurd conspiracy theories .

' before mel started her own treatment she said she understood why the majority of mothers wanted to keep quiet during the process of ivf as it was long , draining , intrusive , emotional , and for some parents , financially hard . ` but when you are through the battle and are holding your precious baby , you should be happy and proud ... do n't feel embarrassed to say \" they were born through ivf \" you need to realise that science helped you with the end result , ' she said on her blog . the 33-year-old went public about it as she wanted to help remove the stigma that women can feel about having ivf treatment she hit the headlines in december 2012 for her involvement in an infamous royal prank call with fellow dj , michael christian ( right ) , they posed as the queen and prince charles in a phone prank that ended in tragedy ` but it was you who decided to bring that child into this world , it was you ( and partner/donor ) who provided the magical ingredients to make your baby . ` and it is you who is going to smother this child with unconditional love and support for the rest of their life and that is what truly makes you a \" normal \" mother . ' mel has had to overcome challenges in her life before . in december 2012 she was hosting on 2 day fm with fellow dj michael christian when they posed as the queen and prince charles , and rang the london hospital where the real life duchess of cambridge was suffering severe morning sickness with her first child . nurse jacintha saldanha who answered the phone and put the call through to the ward took her own life two days later and cited the distress at being fooled as one of the reasons . the pair 's call was answered by nurse jacintha saldanha who later committed suicide . she cited the stress caused by the prank as one of the reasons why she took her own life however , after coming to terms with the tragedy and fallout from it , mel is ready to take on the next challenge that life has thrown at her - the daunting prospect of ivf treatment . ` as i sit here loading up my first syringe i 'm thinking , \" i hope i do this right . if my doctor does n't answer which friend can i call to ask for advice ? \" women help each other , it 's what we do , ' she blogged . ` but how can we do that if we do n't know who to ask for help ? support networks are so important . i will share as much of this journey as i can , through the pain , heartache , joy ... and i hope i do n't feel the need to keep it private too . mel has had great support from her husband steven ( right ) as she starts her ivf program ` if you are a part of this elite club and you know someone going through ivf , maybe take that first step and privately reach out letting them know you too have membership and you are there for them if they need someone .

' and local reporters have also found inconsistencies with the leaked affidavit . according to wbal reporter jayne miller , police originally said that the second prisoner in the van told investigators that gray was ` mostly quiet ' . sources also told the station that by the time the second prisoner was in the van , gray was unresponsive . cell phone footage captured the moment gray was arrested by police near a housing project in west baltimore on april 12 . police say gray fled when they tried to talk to him , and that after tackling him to the ground they found him carrying an illegal switchblade knife and took him into custody . clues : the hour-long period between gray 's arrest ( captured in bystander video above ) and his arrival at the hospital has remained a relative mystery until the washington post obtained the sealed affidavit gray appeared to still have some mobility when officers were putting him into the police van , but it 's unclear how much officers were aiding him into the car gray died the morning of april 19 at the university of maryland shock trauma center from his spinal injuries in the bystander video , two officers are seen pinning gray to the concrete with their knees . when they pick him up to lead him to the van , gray appears to struggle with walking and can be heard yelling out in pain . the image of gray being placed in the van is the last time he is seen before arriving at the hospital about an hour later with a partially severed spinal cord . police have so far denied causing gray 's injuries , but have not explained how he became so severely injured in their custody . baltimore police commissioner anthony batts claims gray had the capacity to walk since he is seen stepping into the police van in the bystander video . about five minutes into the 30-minute ride , the police officer driving the vehicle pulled over to put gray in leg irons . that officer described gray as ` irate ' and ` continued to be combative in the police wagon ' , batts said . angered : gray 's death has sparked protests not only in baltimore , but across the nation . above , thousands took part in a student-led protest in baltimore on wednesday after another five minutes , the officer made yet another stop , asking another cop to check on gray . that officer found gray on the floor because he had not been properly restrained with a seat belt - a violation of department policy . during this stop , gray asked for medical help due to his asthma and batts said officers ignored gray 's worries and continued on to pick up the other prisoner - the 38-year-old man quoted in the recently-released affidavit . when the van arrived at the jail for booking 30 minutes after gray 's arrest , he was found on the floor of the vehicle unconscious . he was taken straight to the hospital , and died a week later due to a severed spinal cord . the baltimore police department is still conducting their investigation into gray 's arrest . it was originally thought that the report would be released on friday , when the department hands over their findings to the state attorney 's office . however , a police spokesman clarified that statement on wednesday , saying they would be not be releasing anything to the public and the decision to do so would be up to prosecutors . six police officers involved in gray 's arrest and transportation are currently suspended pending the investigation . the report was released on the same day that a family member of one of the six officers involved in gray 's arrest spoke out to defend their loved one on cnn . defending the cops : a relative of one of the six police officers currently suspended over gray 's arrest spoke with cnn on wednesday the family member , who chose to remain anonymous but appears to be female , said she was speaking out because she did n't think it was right that no one was standing up for the officers . she says her law enforcement relative , who she says is african american , believes gray was injured before he was taken away in the police van on april 12 . the relative also shot down allegations that the police officer behind the wheel of the van may have driven eratically on purpose to get back at an ` irate ' gray . she says that since paddy wagon drivers are called to the scene of arrests , the driver would n't have been emotionally involved with what happened when gray was apprehended . while she believes that her relative is free from any blame , she added that she suspects the police department is hiding something and that there may be a few ` bad apples ' amongst their ranks . ` why ca n't they figure out whether this gentleman was injured when he was being chased ? or where he was injured ? there are a million cameras everywhere . ' the relative says her biggest fear is that all six officers will be punished for gray 's death , which she thinks only a few may have been directly responsible for . when asked how her relatives is doing , the woman responds : ` how would anybody be doing in a situation like this ? in a situation where you got out there , you risk your life , you make a little bit of money and then something bad happens and nobody is standing behind you , such as the city that you served . ` how would anybody be doing when someone is dead ? just because they wear that uniform does n't mean that they do n't hurt or that they 're not upset or that they do n't blame themselves . ` they 're human beings not machines .

' phil mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on thursday does he pay much attention to the world rankings ? ` you notice , for sure , ' he said . ` i 'm very proud of the fact i 've been in the world 's top five for practically the whole of the last three years . it 's a nice ego thing , so by the end of the year i 'm hoping there wo n't be any slippage . ` but right now , i 've got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you 're playing well . i 'm in all the tournaments i want to be in , so there 's no need to worry on that score . typically , your good years are built around four or five really good weeks , so you have to stay patient . ' he 'd certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one . rose paid a reconnaissance visit to augusta last monday and felt the same old thrill . ` it 's such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet , you still pinch yourself , ' he said . ` i think if i 'd had a crystal ball when i was 13 or 14 and it had said i 'd get to play augusta every year , i 'd have been very happy with that . ' he 's certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date . rose might be the only player in masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one . his best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007 , when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six . paul casey celebrated his last-gasp masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 ` the masters has probably been less on my mind this year because i am trying to find some form , ' he admitted . ` but i think the fact i 've had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead . regardless of what happens here , i feel comfortable on that course and know i can manage my game even if it 's not 100 per cent . you draw off the energy of the place . ' mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty , a three-time masters champion , is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket . ` it was a good start to the tournament and now i 'm looking for three more good rounds , ' he said . ` this is a big week for me . i felt the game was close last week . the only thing missing was chipping and short game . ' paul casey , like mickelson another former winner of this event , celebrated his last-gasp masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes . in the afternoon wave , padraig harrington and lee westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under ."</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"justin rose bounced back from florida misery by carding 69 in houston . three-time masters champion phil mickelson enjoyed return to form . paul casey celebrated last-gasp masters invitation with fine round of 68"</pre></v></r></jlstruct></jltree></v></r><r><k>15</k><v><jltree class="collapsed">SummaryPair<jlstruct><r><k>source</k><v><pre>"a restless baby has been lulled to sleep by her father 's impression of darth vader . madison avery crotty , from san diego , is seen screaming and crying until her doting dad decides to try out his terrifying impersonation . in a new video posted online , the wriggling one-month-old seems to doze off as soon as thomas ` buddy ' starts his deep breathing technique . little madison crotty is seen crying until her doting father buddy decided to try out his impersonation buddy had tried out several types of ` white noise ' sounds to try and get madison to sleep . and he 's seen looking delighted to discover that his daughter finds the star wars sound soothing , saying : ` she likes the dark side !

time there was no man in a grim reaper costume waiting for the manchester united manager behind the dug-out at goodison park . the dark days of ridicule for the barclays premier league 's most successful club have now gone . nevertheless , there was a reminder here for david moyes 's successor at united that the task before him remains vast . moyes lost 2-0 here just over a year ago and it transpired to be his last game in charge . this result for louis van gaal was a goal worse , the performance just as disappointing . james mccarthy finishes past david de gea to put everton ahead in just the fifth minute , following a blistering counter-attack mccarthy celebrates his strike in front of the goodison park crowd as everton began brightly against manchester united john stones ( second left ) watches as ashley young can only divert his header into the net via the underside of the crossbar stones celebrates after his superb header had doubled everton 's lead and put roberto martinez 's side in control before half time kevin mirallas slots home everton 's third to round off a brilliant display of counter-attacking football , with de gea well beaten mirallas celebrates scoring to put the result beyond doubt , after united had appealed for offside against romelu lukaku the dutchman 's biggest defeat as united manager , this setback has arrived just when the optimists were beginning to talk as though the repair job at old trafford was complete . there has been talk of a title challenge for next season and hope that united would once more finish above manchester city this time round . consistency remains an issue for united , however , and last week 's rather unjust defeat at chelsea has now been followed by a failure that was altogether more comprehensive . louis van gaal could scarcely believe what he was seeing as his side found themselves well beaten down despite dominating possession in the same fixture last season a man dressed as the grim reaper

player ratings with liverpool threatening to end the season lamely , united really should finish the season comfortably in the champions league places , even if the gap between the clubs could be a single point by the time united face west bromwich on saturday evening . nevertheless , on sunday there were signs of weakness in this united side that van gaal perhaps presumed he had banished . the renaissance man marouane fellaini , for example , was awful and hauled off at half-time . juan mata -- never one to influence a game when his team are struggling -- was replaced by angel di maria . united 's left defensive flank , meanwhile , represented a permanently half-open door as paddy mcnair and luke shaw struggled to deal with the rather predictable threat from everton 's surging right back seamus coleman . united enjoyed enough possession throughout to get something from the game . they were porous at the back , though , and were put to the sword by an everton team who have been anything but ruthless for the previous eight months of the season . afterwards , van gaal claimed his staff had identified complacency during the warm-up . if that is true then maybe the united manager should have said something in his pre-match address to halt it . regardless , his suggestion that his team lost three individual duels in the build-up to the first goal was telling and james mccarthy 's strike illustrated how the afternoon was to play out for both sides . it came in only the fifth minute and set the tone . england midfielder ross barkley tracks manchester united 's spain international juan mata as the visitors dominated possesion daley blind ( right ) and paddy mcnair both pulled out of a tackle inside their own box , to allow mccarthy in to score roberto martinez celebrates as his side take the lead , thanks to mccarthy 's calm finish , with an enthusiastic fist pump marouane fellaini clatters into the back of gareth barry as he endured a difficult return to goodison park on sunday afternoon fellaini was booked early on , as well as blazing an excellent chance over the bar , against the team he represented for five seasons united had begun reasonably well . they passed the ball well at chelsea last weekend and began this game in a similar groove . as soon as the ball broke loose 10 yards inside the everton half , though , it seemed as though united were already in trouble . seeing green grass ahead of him , mccarthy strode forward to feed coleman to his right . the everton defender tried to find romelu lukaku breaking through the centre but it was when the ball broke from a red shirt that united really failed . mccarthy , following up the move he had started , was first to the loose ball but still had much to do . his first touch was not perfect but the attempts to halt his progress from mcnair and daley blind were weak and mccarthy was able to break through and score from just six yards . from an everton point of view , it was a superb , counter-attacking goal . it should have been stopped at source , though , and united 's attempts to gain parity over the next 30 minutes similarly lacked conviction . blind could have scored with a shot from the edge of the area and so could fellaini , while chris smalling headed a mata free-kick straight at tim howard . with so much of the game still to run , there was no sense of panic from united . the next goal was always likely to be crucial , however , and once everton scored it 10 minutes before half-time the road back already looked too long for van gaal 's team . england defender stones was left almost entirely unmarked , and got up higher than antonio valencia or marouane fellaini to score young , stationed on the line , did his best to head the ball away , while david de gea could only watch on helpless as it ended up in the net once again the danger started down everton 's right . on this occasion the united defence cleared for a corner but when baines delivered , john stones arrived to head his first everton goal . two ahead now , everton were truly in command for the first time . van gaal responded at the break by benching fellaini -- who had been booked -- and sending on radamel falcao . once again , united enjoyed possession . wayne rooney was denied by howard as he shot on the turn following a corner in the 47th minute but at the other end shaw had to be quick to stop the breaking ross barkley . de gea looks exasperated after seeing his side fall further behind , as he could not repeat his heroics against everton from earlier in the season fellaini , who was replaced at half time , prepares to kick off after everton 's second goal , as wayne rooney looks on dejected radamel falcao came on at half time for fellaini , but was unable to have much of an impact as united continued to struggle for penetration luke shaw slides in hard on ross barkley but it was the everton man who came out on top in the battle between the england starlets wayne rooney and juan mata look to break down the everton defence but without joy as gareth barry and leon osman close them down phil jagielka slides in brilliantly to stop rooney 's progress as everton limited united 's chances while capitalising on the break aston villa ( away ) - may 2 sunderland ( home ) - may 9 west ham ( away ) - may 16 tottenham ( home ) - may 24 west brom ( home ) - may 2 crystal palace ( away ) - may 9 arsenal ( home ) - may 17 hull ( away ) - may 24 barkley was , in truth , having a mixed afternoon . eventually , however , the 21-year-old got it right , playing the ball smartly over the top towards substitute kevin mirallas with 16 minutes left . lukaku , breaking through the middle , looked yards offside and probably was . however , the ball had been played in the direction of mirallas , and as the united defence looked for a flag , the belgian eased clear to beat david de gea comfortably and intelligently with his right instep . in the visiting dug-out , van gaal was already preparing his fiercest post-match shellacking of the season . he now has six days to elicit a reaction . ashley young is forced to wrestle everton 's on-loan winger aaron lennon , who put in another excellent display , to the floor mirallas slots home to finish off united with a cool finish after the visiting defence had completely switched off it was a difficult day for england captain rooney , who was replaced late on after appearing to be injured , against his former club falcao managed to find the net late on , slotting past tim howard , but the

the jerome combs detention center in kankakee at about 3 a.m. . he somehow escaped from his cell , hid inside the facility , then beat and choked the guard who was making rounds , said kankakee county sheriff timothy bukowski . taylor , a 23-year-old from kankakee , is considered armed and dangerous , the sheriff said . he was convicted of first-degree murder in february and faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison . on the run : convicted murderer kamron t. taylor escaped from jail early wednesday not going quietly : in this photo taken in february , taylor was removed from a kankakee county courtroom after struggling with the deputies and yelling at the crowd in the gallery after being found guilty of murder besides hunting him down , investigators were eager to determine how taylor got free in what was the first successful escape from the decade-old lockup housing about 450 detainees . escaped : the 23-year-old taylor was awaiting sentencing when authorities say he beat a guard into unconsciousness , took his keys and uniform and sped off in his suv ` the speculation on my part is somebody did n't do their job properly , ' bukowski said . after getting free of his two-man cell in a lockdown unit , taylor hid out and attacked the guard , a military veteran with 10 years of correctional experience , bukowski said . by wearing the guard 's uniform , taylor was able to fool other guards in a master control room who opened three sets of doors for him after visual verification by surveillance video , bukowski said . once outside , the suspect repeatedly pressed the guard 's key fob to locate his chevrolet equinox in a parking lot and drive away . authorities did n't learn of the escape until about 30 minutes later , when jail staff found the wounded officer , who is hospitalized in intensive care with head wounds . ` he was in and out of consciousness , unable to understand the questions that were given to him , ' bukowski said of the guard at a news conference . a few hours after sunrise , officers found the abandoned suv in a residential area of kankakee and approached the vehicle with their guns drawn . but taylor was nowhere to be found and it was n't clear whether he fled on foot or someone picked him up in another vehicle , the sheriff said . at one point wednesday , authorities issued an alert for a 15-year-old girl , savannah bell , who they believed was with taylor . illinois state police later announced the girl had been found , but did not say where or how officials found her or whether she had been with taylor . wanted

staffing levels and procedures will be re-examined , but bukowski said taylor 's history of violence and previous escape attempts did n't necessarily single him out for stricter security measures . `

attack on its soil , kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in somalia , according to a military source , who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at garissa university college that killed nearly 150 people . \" the latest attack of al-shabaab bases by the kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011 . it is not a retaliation to the garissa attack . the operation has been ongoing , \" the military source said monday . it is customary for kenyan military sources not to give their names to media . two of the airstrikes hit al-shabaab training camps , according to a resident of the southwest somalian town of bardera , almost 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) from the kenyan border , and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety . the kenyan military began its bombing raids sunday afternoon , targeting the al-shabaab stronghold of godon dhawe , somali resident ibrahim mohammed said . godon dhawe is between bardera and the somalia-kenya border . al-shabaab , an al qaeda-linked militant group based in somalia , has claimed responsibility for the university attack . also monday , a police source said kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in garissa could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in nairobi for hours after the massacre began , arranging for transport . it 's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the kenyan capital , roughly 370 kilometers ( 230 miles ) west of the attack , but the police source in garissa told cnn that kenyan politicians and nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did . journalists on the ground corroborated that report . once the team entered the university complex , the situation was quickly defused , journalists and the police source said . manoah esipisu , a spokesman for kenya 's president and deputy president , defended the response time , telling cnn there is always criticism regarding whether \" you reacted as fast as you have or should n't have . \" \" with the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better , \" he said , adding that kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and \" got the job done . \" foreign minister amina mohamed echoed those remarks in a monday interview with cnn , saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation . \" we have a military garrison in garissa , and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists . so the response was adequate , \" she said . she repeated esipisu 's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight . \" obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning , it 's always easy to fall back on things like that , but i can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported , \" mohamed said . \" obviously hindsight is always 20/20 . we did everything that we could do . \" the kenyan government says mohamed mohamud is the mastermind of thursday 's terrorist attack on garissa university college . the country 's interior ministry singled out mohamud , a senior leader of al-shabaab , on twitter . he is also known by the aliases dulyadin and gamadhere , it said . mohamud is \" credited with having an extensive terrorist network within kenya , \" according to a kenyan ministry document given to cnn . the ministry posted a \" most wanted \" notice for mohamud . it offers a reward of 20 million kenyan shillings , about \$ 215,000 . \" we appeal to anyone with any info on #gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies , \" the interior ministry posted on twitter . mohamud is in charge of external operations against kenya , the document says , and he is the regional commander within al-shabaab in charge of the juba region . in this role , he commands the militia along the border and \" is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country . \" his position as one of al-shabaab 's top field commanders in southern somalia has brought him into direct conflict with kenyan troops deployed as part of african union forces in the country . \" this is a man who has a lot of grudges against the kenyans , \" said stig jarle hansen , an associate professor at oslo 's norwegian university of life sciences and author of \" al-shabaab in somalia : the history and ideology of a militant islamist group . \" mohamud 's network extends within the dadaab refugee camp , the document says . dadaab is the world 's biggest refugee camp , home to thousands of people , according to the united nations . it 's in kenya 's north eastern province near somalia . garissa , the town where the university attack took place , is about 150 kilometers ( 90 miles ) from the somali border . it 's within \" striking distance \" of mohamud 's stronghold in somalia 's middle juba province , hansen told cnn . but he noted that mohamud is better known \" for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks . \" inside garissa university college dorm 's scene of slaughter over the weekend , al-shabaab promised to bring about \" another bloodbath \" in kenya . though the terrorist group is based in somalia , it has n't confined its violence to the lawless nation . in 2013 , militants attacked nairobi 's upscale westgate mall . mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years , including december 's attack on a quarry in a kenyan village near the somali border , which killed at least 36 people . in that attack , al-shabaab militants separated non-muslim workers from their muslim counterparts and killed them . mohamud is kenyan and has three wives and three siblings , including two with links to al-shabaab , the document says . he 's from a clan , the ogaden , that has a heavy presence in kenya and somalia , hansen said . \" the borders historically have been meaningless to them , \" he said . cnn exclusive : exposing smuggler routes across the somalia-kenya border on sunday , kenya 's interior ministry identified another terrorist involved in the garissa university college attack as abdirahim abdullahi . abdullahi 's father , abdullahi daqare , a government chief in mandera in northern kenya , told cnn that his son was missing . daqare is a kenyan somali , he said . his son graduated in 2013 from nairobi university law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing , daqare said in a phone interview . \" i have received reports from people who found information ( on ) the internet that my son was one of the terrorists , \" daqare said . \" i previously told the government that the son is missing . i sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son . \" he added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared . daqare said he had \" really given up on him . \" on sunday , families of some of the more than 147 people slain at garissa university college left a mortuary in nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones . one woman almost had to be carried out . where are you , my children ? \" across garissa , there was a sense of fear , foreboding and grief . the news agency reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter 's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people . a church member told the agency , \" nowhere is safe , but here in church you can come , you be with god and then you just console yourself . \" three days of national mourning for victims of the attack , declared by kenyan president uhuru kenyatta , began sunday . cnn 's christian purefoy and lilian leposo reported from garissa ; eliott c. mclaughlin and greg botelho wrote from atlanta ; and jethro mullen reported and wrote from hong kong . cnn 's christiane amanpour , mick krever , david mckenzie , dominique

disease . but in reality her son david rylance , 47 , had been slowly siphoning the money away , spending it on luxuries for himself as well as everyday living costs . a # 13,000 fee to move his mother , from south shields , into a care home in january 2013 had to be paid by the council because her bank balance had been diminished by her son 's spending . newcastle crown court heard one of mrs rylance 's accounts held just # 1,000 at the time of her death in july 2013 . her son continued to access the cash until the balance was zero . rylance , also of south shields , admitted theft and fraud involving # 52,000 and was jailed for two years and three months . judge penny moreland told him : ` your mother had had anxieties in the last years of her life that her money was going missing but , because of her illness , that was not taken seriously . ` this was a gross breach of trust . it is hard to imagine someone more vulnerable than an elderly lady with alzheimer 's , unable to protect herself from you accessing her accounts and taking what you wanted . ` you simply treated her money as your own . ' the court heard rylance was in charge of an appointee account set up at lloyds bank , which held his mother 's cash after her alzheimer 's diagnosis in 2009 . prosecutor tim gittins told the court : ` it is clear , very soon after he opened the account , he began to use the monies for his own purposes . ' rylance would transfer large sums of cash from the account into his own , which he used for online gambling , mr gittins said . newcastle crown court ( pictured ) heard one of mrs rylance 's accounts held just # 1,000 at the time of her death in july 2013 he would also place bets on gambling sites directly from the appointee account . ` the amounts of monies varied from a couple of hundred pounds to # 8,000 in one particular month in june 2010 , ' mr gittins added . ` there were , in fact , substantial wins over that period as well . ' the court heard rylance also had access to his mother 's regular banks accounts , which he also stole from . mr gittins said the crimes had a devastating impact on rylance 's sister lesley wilson . the prosecutor said : ' [ ms wilson ] said it was a physical blow to find out the truth of it . ` she describes her mother and father had very little when they started out and had built up what they had by working very hard . ` she was devastated to find out the monies had been spent in the way they had by the defendant . ` there had been concerns expressed prior to her death by mrs rylance herself about monies going missing and the like . to a certain extent it was put down to her deteriorating condition . ' prosecutors accepted rylance 's claim that some of the cash was used for his mother 's benefit . vic laffey , defending , said rylance felt ` shame and remorse ' for what he did . mr laffey said : ` he tried to get himself out of a hole when all he achieved was to dig himself further in . ` he was drowning in obligations . he was in the grip of quite significant financial problems and in particular a significant and debilitating gambling addiction .

one is on top -- the left one or the right ? if you are a man , the odds are it will be the left ; if you are a woman , it is more likely to be the right . now unfold your hands and take a look at your fingers , in particular your index finger ( next to your thumb ) and your ring finger ( next to your little finger ) . it can be quite subtle , but in men the ring finger ( measured from the crease where it joins the hand ) is likely to be longer than the index finger . in women the two fingers are typically the same length . strangely enough , your hands give clues to what is sometimes called ` brain sex ' -- the way your brain reflects your gender . of course , we all have different skills and interests , but some are considered more typically male , and occur more commonly in men , while others are described as more typically female , and occur more commonly in women . according to popular mythology , men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts . you find men in pubs discussing the top speed of a car they are never going to drive , let alone own . they cling to the tv remote control . they like spending time in sheds . women , on the other hand , are said to be better at empathy and understanding what another person is feeling or needs . in an emotional crisis , they are more likely to offer sympathy . if you are a man you may be surprised to learn that there are more than 400 different human emotions . if you 're a woman you probably knew that already . this is the stuff of jokes and self-help books -- but it is also shown to be true through science . the question is , do these tendencies result from nature -- with the biological gender we are born with deciding our interests and personalities -- or do they result from nurture , with society and upbringing creating the differing ways that men and women behave ? in the sbs one series horizon professor alice roberts and dr michael mosley examine the links between gender and the brain the sbs one series horizon asked professor alice roberts and me to investigate . we started from very different positions . alice thinks apparent brain differences between the sexes have been exaggerated by how our culture treats boys and girls . in the programme she carries out fascinating tests to prove her point , such as dressing up little boys as girls and vice versa and watching how people treat them . almost immediately , the girls start rough-housing and playing with trucks , while the boys are treated far more gently by the adults around them . she argues that parents ' unconscious actions -- such as being gentler with girls and letting boys behave more roughly -- often mould children into men and women who embody gender stereotypes . while i agree that lots of wild generalisations about men and women are bandied around , i also think there may be something in claims that our fundamental biology influences how we behave . professor simon baron-cohen , an expert on the brain who i visited at cambridge university , has done a lot of pioneering work on this . he believes , broadly , that people of whatever gender fall somewhere along a ` systemiser ' to ` empathiser ' spectrum . systemisters : according to popular mythology , men tend to be more obsessed by things such as cars and obscure facts , like these young train spotters pictured at chislehurst and sidcup station systemisters are people who enjoy breaking down and analysing systems . they are more likely to become train spotters or computer scientists . they are what he has called ` male brained ' -- as these qualities occur most frequently , but far from exclusively , in men . empathisers , on the other hand , are more typically ` female ' brained as they are more typically women . although there are exceptions , most men -- when tested -- come out as more ` systemising ' than ` empathising ' , while for women it is the other way round . while professor baron-cohen accepts social pressures are important in influencing choices and behaviour , his studies suggest the hormones babies are exposed to in the womb can also shape the brain . higher levels of testosterone in utero , for example -- as measured in long-term studies that took samples from pregnant women then followed their children from birth -- are associated with offspring who are less empathetic but better at some mental skills later in life . in other words , more testosterone during pregnancy produces babies with a more male brain ( we 're not yet sure why some mothers produce more testosterone ) . dr mosley will examine if habits , characteristics and preferences are a result of ` nature or nurture ' empathisers , on the other hand , are more typically ` female ' brained as they are more typically women an indirect way of assessing how much testosterone you were exposed to is by looking at your fingers . a number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more ` male ' your brain is likely to be . mine is slightly more ` male ' than average but much less so than , say , a professional footballer , who is typically male brained with great spatial awareness skills . as you can imagine , this is a controversial area of science . professor baron-cohen does these studies because he is interested in autism , which he describes as an extreme version of the male brain -- more interested in systems and often struggling with empathy . when he started his research there was a lot of criticism , based partly on the fear studies like his will be used to support unhelpful stereotypes -- suggesting men ca n't excel in female areas and vice versa . ignoring gender differences , however , comes with its own dangers . take the problem of pain . a while ago , when i was making a programme called pleasure and pain , we did a survey where we asked people which of the sexes they thought was better at tolerating pain -- 81 per cent of women said ` women ' , while a mere 11 per cent thought men were the tougher breed . a number of studies have shown that the greater the difference between the length of the ring finger and the index finger , the more ` male ' your brain is likely to be although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed ` women ' were more stoical . one way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test . this is a standard pain test widely used because it causes acute pain without doing any long-term damage ( as long as you do n't do it for more than 15 minutes ) . in this test , you put your hand in a bucket of ice-cold water and see how long you can keep it there before the pain becomes intolerable . i 've done it a couple of times and oddly enough after the initial shock it does n't actually feel cold ; below about 3 degrees celsius your pain receptors overwhelm your temperature receptors so you are no longer able to tell if the water is hot or freezing . all you know is that it is incredibly painful . when this test is done in a laboratory setting , men almost always outlast women . this may be pure machismo , but professor jeff mogil of mcgill university , montreal , thinks there is more to it . as he puts it : ` there are all kinds of reasons to believe there are different neural systems in the brain of males and females . ' that is , our brains process pain differently because our brains are different : our varying ability to withstand pain is proof . he thinks it is unfortunate that much basic pain research has , until recently , been done in male animals . although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt , the majority , 54 per cent , still agreed ` women ' were more stoical males do n't menstruate or go on heat , which makes them simpler and cheaper to study . but it also means we have been developing and testing drugs on males , assuming that they will work just as well on females , which may not be the case . we 've come to realise , for example , paracetamol works better on men , while some opioids work better on women . we do n't , however , know why . that situation is now changing as researchers involve more females and start actively looking for differences . indeed , jeff imagines a future where pharmaceutical companies produce pain-killing drugs that are specific to one gender . so perhaps we 'll have pink painkillers for women , and blue ones for boys , each honed to work on the specific male or female brain . ` if that happens , ' says jeff , ` that 'll be a first in medicine . ' it may also mean far more effective medication for all of us . head injury , a leading cause of death and disability in young people , is another area where studying gender differences could bring significant benefits . is your brain male or female ? documentary premieres on sbs one on monday at 7.30 pm a couple of years ago , i was in a large military hospital in afghanistan , filming a series called frontline medicine for the bbc . i saw a number of soldiers , male and female , with serious head injuries . i was told that the women were likely to make a better recovery than the men . it may be , in part , because women have higher levels of progesterone . progesterone is best known as a female hormone , involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy , but it is also important for the development of neurones -- the cells that carry messages in the brain . animal studies and a few small human trials have shown that giving progesterone soon after suffering a brain injury improves survival and recovery . larger studies , some of them funded by the military , are currently underway . this , i think , is why researching gender differences is worth doing . it is not because it will help us understand why men struggle to remember their children 's birthdays or why there are fewer female darts players , but because it may help us find more effective ways to tackle disease . is your brain male or female ? documentary premieres on sbs one on monday at 7.30 pm tests extracted from a quiz at bbc.co.uk / science/humanbody/sex , devised in conjunction with dr simon baron-cohen"</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"a person 's brain often reflects their gender . however their hands can also indicate if their brain is more female or male . why are some skills or characteristics considered male or female-specific ? . documentary examines if gender-specific traits are due to biology ( occuring from birth ) or develop as a result of environment . the film examines different theories and studies about gender and the brain . study says fingers can indicate how much testosterone is in a person 's body . is your brain male or female ? documentary premieres on sbs one on monday at 7.30 pm"</pre></v></r></jlstruct></jltree></v></r><r><k>11486</k><v><jltree class="collapsed">SummaryPair<jlstruct><r><k>source</k><v><pre>"ed miliband is paying an argentinian company which has attacked ` vulture ' american bankers to help him become prime minister . left-wing , buenos aires-based tectonica is responsible for the websites of more than 200 labour parliamentary candidates , including senior figures such as shadow foreign secretary and election chief douglas alexander and shadow defence minister vernon coaker , who oversee the party 's policy on the falklands . it also designed the websites of harriet harman , andy burnham and tristram hunt . ed miliband is paying an argentinian company which has attacked ` vulture ' american bankers to help him become prime minister tory mps last night claimed labour 's argentinian link was an ` embarrassment ' for miliband . tectonica -- dubbed ` argie &amp; argie ' in a jokey reference to saatchi &amp; saatchi , the agency that famously helped margaret thatcher win the 1979 election -- is best known for its aggressive campaign against the us in a row over argentina 's debt crisis , which dates back to the 1982 falklands war . its website echoes argentinian president cristina kirchner 's attack on ` senile ' us judge thomas griesa , who ruled last year that argentina must drop its refusal to pay back nearly # 1 billion to us investors . conservative mp nadhim zahawi said : ` if ed miliband becomes prime minister he would plunge britain into debt so it is no surprise he is trying to win using a company that believes governments should default on their debts . ` britain has the best website designers in the world , yet labour chooses a firm from argentina to work for them . it is absurd and deeply embarrassing for them .

perhaps from pesticide exposure , federal officials say -- during a trip to the u.s. virgin islands . steve esmond , his teenage sons and the teens ' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in st. john , where they were renting a villa at the sirenusa resort . the family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery , according to a statement released monday from the family 's attorney , james maron . the teens ' mother , theresa devine , was treated at a hospital and released , and is in occupational therapy , maron said . the u.s. environmental protection agency said friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in st. john may have caused the illnesses , which were reported to the epa on march 20 . paramedics were called to the villa , which the family was renting . esmond was found unconscious ; the boys and their mother were having seizures , maron said . the lawyer did not say who called the paramedics . elias rodriguez , an epa spokesman , said the agency 's preliminary test results \" do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying . \" exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects , including central nervous system and respiratory system damage , according to the epa . the use of the pesticide is restricted in the united states because of its acute toxicity . it 's not allowed to be used indoors . only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings . for example , the pesticide is injected into the soil of some u.s. strawberry fields , said judith enck , an epa regional administrator . \" we trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there 's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries , \" enck said . \" you definitely want to wash them really good . \" this is a pesticide that 's been around for a long time , and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer , it 's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant , \" enck added . field workers at a connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990 , according to the journal of industrial medicine . in 2011 , warehouse workers in california fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from chile fumigated with methyl bromide , the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention said . dr. sanjay gupta , cnn 's chief medical correspondent , said many parts of the world banned the chemical , a neurotoxin . the agent is to be used only outdoors . the chemical is also odorless and colorless , gupta said . \" it 's not something that you would have any warning of , \" gupta said . the chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence , he added . the epa said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on march 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated . enck , the epa regional administrator , said paramedics were called early on march 20 . sea glass vacations , which acts as a rental agent for several units at sirenusa , said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests , but that the family 's unit was not treated . the company said it licensed an outside company , terminix , for the pest control services . on monday , it ended its contract with terminix . in an email to cnn before the termination , a spokesman for terminix wrote that the company is \" committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers , employees , the public and the environment \" and is \" looking into this matter internally , and cooperating with authorities . \" the u.s. department of justice has initiated a criminal investigation . \" many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured , distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family 's injuries , \" maron said . the attorney added : \" the family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable . \" cnn 's rob frehse , jean casarez , sara ganim , jason hanna , laura ly and michael martinez contributed to this report ."</pre></v></r><r><k>target</k><v><pre>"chemical damages ozone and is being

premier league . here against west ham he scored his 20th of the campaign . and in david silva and jesus navas , not to mention a seemingly revitalised yaya toure , they had players far too accomplished for the quality of this opposition . but such a dominant , determined display must leave the club 's owners wondering why on earth this was only their third win in nine games after a run of six defeats in their previous eight . why , even when west ham were as abject as they were until city lost silva to serious injury , they have been unable to play with such confidence more frequently . sergio aguero slotted manchester city into a two goal lead after a fine flowing counter attack by the home side against west ham the argentine striker sprints away in celebration having

united lost , eases the pressure on manuel pellegrini . but there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in abu dhabi that the last few months have proved so problematic . by the end of this encounter the greater , more pressing , concern was for the welfare of silva . injured from what both managers agreed was an accidental elbow in the face from cheikhou kouyate midway through the second half , the spanish international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment . he was then taken to hospital . but other problems nevertheless remain for city 's manager pellegrini when he had to wake to headlines being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of toure , who reportedly accused the chilean of being ` a weak manager ' as well as criticising other prominent members of the club hierarchy , too . pellegrini was asked to respond but declined to comment . with managers such as jurgen klopp now available for hire , these stories are poorly timed for pellegrini . but he can at least take comfort in the way his team responded to that crushing defeat at old trafford the previous weekend . ` after two defeats in a row it was a very important win , ' added pellegrini . manchester city manager manuel pellegrini watches on at the etihad stadium as his side seeked to get back to winning ways on sunday cheikhou kouyate ( left )

next , against aston villa , city 's manager is sure to be encouraged by the form of aguero . until sunday he had failed to score a premier league goal from open play at the etihad since november 2 . but the goal he scored in this contest was neatly taken ; much more like the striker city 's subdued supporters have grown to admire . he thrived on the possession city were enjoying -- 75 per cent for the first 15 minutes -- and joined silva and alek-sandar kolarov in threatening west ham 's goal early on . city 's opening goal , scored after 18 minutes , was an absolute horror for west ham . first came aaron cresswell 's failure to win an aerial contest with the diminutive navas , and then a spectacular own goal from james collins . winger stewart downing ( centre ) attempts to avoid the

unfortunate for the visitors it remained a product of the pressure city were exerting . a west ham side probably unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding their own manager offered little in return .

nevertheless remained with city , a second goal arriving in the 36th minute after toure had regained possession from stewart downing . a rapidly executed counter-attack followed , with aguero and navas combining impressively before aguero slotted home his 101st manchester city goal . in the dug-out sam allardyce appeared thoroughly hacked off , and understandably so given the ineptitude of his defenders and his side 's lack of ambition going forward . he responded at the start of the second half by pushing valencia into a more attacking role alongside cole . but it was city who continued to press , with adrian doing well to deny aguero a second . the injury to silva -- earning kouyate a yellow card despite the fact that it really did n't look intentional -- disrupted city 's rhythm and gave west ham a little encouragement . downing went close , as did valencia . for once pellegrini had reason to feel a touch more secure . manchester city playmaker david silva slips through a pass

\$ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ? these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \" 100 days of rejection \" , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born . after his tech start-up was declined investment , jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on . this led to his writing his book called rejection proof , part self-help and part motivational/autobiography , which is being released this week . famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , jiang asked austin , texas , krispy kreme manager ( jackie braun ) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the olympic symbol . to his surprise , she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered . he shared his video and it went viral on reddit . before long , jiang ( and braun ) were invited on talk shows and jiang was being asked to speak at events across the us . jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew . that was n't the goal of the project though . \" i 'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears , \" explained jiang . the project started out to help \" fix my own problems , and now i 'm helping others fix theirs , \" he said . \" the fear of rejection really holds people back . i 'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection . \" jiang , who as a child dreamed of being bill gates and has been viewed 7 million times on youtube , has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment . \" my goal is to turn rejection into opportunity . i always thought it was something to run away from , but if we can embrace it , we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle . \" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you : 1 - the fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection . by putting ourselves out there , the world will usually open itself up to you . though the world can seem cruel and cold , actually humans have a hard time saying no . so open yourself up , do n't be afraid to ask for something . if you fail , remember it 's not about you . 2 - rejection is more or less a numbers game . sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes . if you talk to enough people , somebody will say yes to you . j.k. rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for harry potter and the philosopher 's stone . 3 - you can not use rejection to measure the merit of an idea . sometimes if you really want to change the world , getting rejection is a must . rejection is a human interaction with two sides . it often says more about the rejector than the rejectee , and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit . 4 - do n't run away after a no . the most common thing we do when we 're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you 're hurt , angry and you lose confidence . but actually if we know how to handle it , we can often minimize the chance of rejection . be confident , engaging , collaborate . i used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes . when you get rejected you have to find out why . then spend time to find solutions to solve that why . sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for . ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position . 6 - set a number of how many no 's you can take . in his book , jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at google . he tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job , she needs to prepare herself for how many no 's she can take . in the end , she was offered a job at google . by the end of his project , jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection . it was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded . it 's like a muscle , i could become stronger and stronger . 8 - stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion . people are who they are . a lot of people will reject you because of their mood , their education , their upbringing , and you ca n't change who they are . but you can stand confidently . how missing sleep can damage your iq the surprising benefits of doing nothing 7 habits of highly ineffective
